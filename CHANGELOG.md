# Changelog

All notable changes to the SmartSuite MCP Server. Versions marked _(unreleased)_ are built and
deployed as incremental `.mcpb` artifacts but not yet published as a GitHub release.

## 0.9.5 — _(unreleased)_
### Added
- **Bulk create records**: `smartsuite_create_records` — batch-create with dry-run/confirm, batch-size cap, and audit; returns created IDs and per-row failures.
- **Compact record output**: `list`/`query`/`search` records accept `format:"compact"`, returning a `{ columns, rows }` table (field names once instead of per-record) — materially fewer tokens on large result sets, lossless for scalar values. Pairs with the existing `fields` projection.
- **Deleted-record recovery**: `smartsuite_list_deleted_records` (readonly, solution-scoped trash listing with `deletedBy`/`deletedAt`) and `smartsuite_restore_records` (gated by `SMARTSUITE_ENABLE_RESTORE` + confirm). `delete_records` now returns the deleted IDs so they can be restored, and its description reflects that deletes are recoverable.
- **Deleted-schema recovery**: `smartsuite_list_deleted_fields` + `smartsuite_restore_field` (restore a deleted field into its table; schema-write-gated + confirm) and `smartsuite_list_deleted_applications` (listing only — SmartSuite has no public restore-application endpoint). `delete_field` now advertises that fields are recoverable via `restore_field`.
- **Dashboard CRUD + widgets**: `smartsuite_create_dashboard` / `update_dashboard` / `delete_dashboard` (create with named tabs, edit tabs/footer/style/enable-tab-bar, gated+confirm delete) and `smartsuite_add_dashboard_widget` / `update_dashboard_widget` / `remove_dashboard_widget`. Widgets support layout (position {x,y} = columns, {y,height} = pixels), settings (name/showName/color/description/collapsed), and moving between tabs. Labels are uniqueness-checked; forms/views are routed to their own tools.
- **Widget template catalog (all 19 types)**: `widgetType` is validated against the 19 real types, and `params` is now OPTIONAL — omit it and `add_dashboard_widget` fills a verified minimal template for that type (data widgets default to the dashboard's own application with sensible field slugs), so any widget is creatable with just `dashboardId` + `widgetType`. Templates were discovered by probing the API and verified to create live on a second application (19/19).
- **View (report) CRUD**: `smartsuite_create_view`, `smartsuite_update_view`, `smartsuite_delete_view`. Create a view of any mode (grid/card/kanban/calendar/timeline/gantt/chart/map) with an optional initial config (visibleFields, filters + operator, sort, groupBy); update renames/re-describes and edits config; delete is gated + confirm-required and refuses the last remaining view. Labels are checked for uniqueness (suggests an alternative), field slugs validated against the schema, and forms/dashboards are routed to their own tools.
### Fixed
- **Automation status reporting**: `enabled` was reported as `null` for both pending and disabled automations, hiding *why* an automation wouldn't run. Write/list/describe results now include `status` (`enabled` | `disabled` | `pending` | `unknown`) and `statusReason` (e.g. "Trigger credential not found"). `system_status` is engine-computed, so create/update responses now note it's validated asynchronously (usually `pending` immediately after a write) and that a `disabled` result means the automation is structurally invalid — not that the write cleared an enabled flag.
### Changed
- `update_automation` / `describe_automation_step` descriptions now warn against rebuilding a trigger/action from the (slimmed) `describe_automation_step` output — doing so drops full input encodings (e.g. an AI action's model) and can strip settings on save. To edit only the name, omit trigger/actions so they're preserved verbatim.

## 0.9.4 — _(unreleased)_
### Changed
- **Leaner schema responses (token cost)**: `describe_application` and `list_fields` now omit per-field boilerplate — `required`/`primary`/`hidden` appear only when true, help text only when present (absence = false/none). Cuts a typical schema payload by ~35–40%. `list_fields` now also returns choice options + linked-app targets, so it's a viable lightweight alternative to `describe_application`.
### Added
- `describe_application` gains `verbosity: compact | standard | full` — `compact` returns just slug/label/type + choice options + linked-app (best for surveys / data work / scanning many tables), `full` appends the raw params blob.
- Tool descriptions now flag schema calls as token-heavy, note the schema is stable within a session (call once per table, reuse — don't re-describe), and steer callers to `list_fields`/`verbosity:"compact"` when they only need field slugs/types.

## 0.9.3 — _(unreleased)_
### Added
- **Select choice descriptions and numeric values**: `create_field`/`update_field` accept `value_help_text` (the option description shown in the dropdown) and `weight` (the option's numeric value, used by formulas/rollups) on single/multi-select choices — e.g. `{label:"High", value_help_text:"Ship this week", weight:3}`. Defaults (`value_help_text:""`, `weight:1`) match UI-created choices; status choices take neither.

## 0.9.2 — _(unreleased)_
### Added
- `smartsuite_delete_field` — delete a field by slug (gated by schema-write + `SMARTSUITE_ENABLE_DELETE`, confirm-required, refuses system fields). Enables replacing a formula with a rollup end-to-end.
### Fixed
- Single/multi/status **select choice colors**: MCP-created choices omitted `value_color`, so dropdowns rendered incorrectly until edited in the UI. `create_field`/`update_field` now auto-assign a color (SmartSuite's default palette, by position) and order to any choice missing one; explicit colors are preserved.
### Changed
- `create_field` documents **rollup** (`{linked_field, field_selection, function}`) and **lookup** (`{linked_field, field_selection}`) params — these field types were always creatable via the generic tool; the guidance makes it discoverable (rollups are not UI-only).

## 0.9.1 — _(unreleased)_
### Added
- `smartsuite_move_layout_field` gains `toTab` — move a field to a **different tab** (removed from its current tab, added to the destination). Plain reorder can't pull a field in from another tab.
- `smartsuite_update_application` — rename a table (`name`) and/or change its record term.

## 0.9.0
- Solution migration / schema diff: `match_solutions`, `match_applications`, `diff_schemas` (tables, fields, views, forms, dashboards), `export_diff` (XLSX + JSON).
- Record-view layout authoring: sections, tabs, `move_layout_field`, `set_field_visibility` (hide/show), `set_display_logic` (field/section/tab visibility conditions).
- Fields: `create_field`/`update_field` (any type), `set_field_help_text` (markdown → help doc); new fields auto-placed in the layout.
- `move_attachments` — move/copy files between file fields.

## 0.8.0
- Forms (list/describe/create/update/submit), My Work, automation create/update/delete.
- Packaging fix: ship `server/package.json` `{"type":"module"}` so the bundle loads on every Node (resolves the "Installing…" hang).

## 0.7.0
- Formula tooling (analyze/validate/create/update), automations, cross-workspace reads, views/dashboards.
